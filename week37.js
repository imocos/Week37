/*
    Hi.
    This is a set of exercises
    The idea is to practice a few things at a time.
    You do this by entering your answer after a task is given (see the example)

    DO NOT change any provided code unless the task specifically tells you to.
*/

    Task: Example
    Write code to print all the names in the list, one name per line

/*
    Task: A
    Write code that prints the sentence "Debugging is like being a detective in a crime drama where you are also the murderer" 
    100 times. 
    Remember we use console.log() to print things out.

    console.log(TEXT_TO_WRITE.TASK_A);

/*
    Task: B
    The following code is incorrect, can you fix the errors?
    This one isn't that simple, there are syntax errors and logical errors.
    Try to think about what we are trying to achieve.
